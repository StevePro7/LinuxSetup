Windows Update ERROR
13/04/2018

Hi all,

If you get the latest Windows update and then Virtual Box stops working and gives the following error,
“VT-x is not available (VERR_VMX_NO_VMX).

Then this appears to fix the problem:

Run cmd prompt as Administrator

Enter the following command
dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V

Restart when prompted

Windows may do some a couple more updates / restarts but Virtual Box should work again afterwards.
