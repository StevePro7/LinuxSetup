KegaFusion
19/12/2017


Not sure exactly what I did but I managed to install Kega Fusion on Ubuntu 16.04

https://segaretro.org/Kega_Fusion

The thing that I think was different from yesterday is that I downloaded the DEB version
DEB seems to be file format for Debian and Ubuntu

i.e.
Kega-fusion_3.63-2_i386.deb

Save file
cd ~/Downloads

sudo apt-get install Kega-fusion_3.63-2_i386.deb
ERROR

sudo dpkg -i Kega-fusion_3.63-2_i386.deb


Initially all of this did not works as there were dependent packages not installed

Terminal
sudo apt-get -f install


I believe this command installs all dependent packages not installed but required previously?
Anyway this downloaded tons of stuff any now Search Kega Fusion works OK
